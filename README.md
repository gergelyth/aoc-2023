Here I usually program the first thing that comes to my mind. Most often this is the simplest, most inelegant logic - in my defense, the tasks get published at 6 AM in my timezone. 

Typically, I don't go back to fix issues unless it's incredibly ugly and it *really* bothers me.

*Python is not my primary language, but I thought it would be fun to do this year's challenge with the snake to improve. Terrible inefficiences expected.*
